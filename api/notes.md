Questions:
1. Give me all parameters vs. what I need right now -- what does that entail?
2. What format should the progress be saved in? Should we just add a server-side storage so the researcher can determine it themselves?
3. Do we really need to send the parameters to the server, or can we trust the hashing determinism in the for-loop?
4. Would any other features be useful, and which ones are MVP vs 2.0?
