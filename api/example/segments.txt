Compared with similarly priced laptops (before the $$$ rebates), the Toshiba A15-S129 does boast a faster processor (2.4 ghz celeron) and the 32 mb video card is more than adequate for most tasks (watching DVDs, word-processing, cruising the net). Included in the price is a combination DVD/CD Writer (most entry level laptops have a CD player). My Toshiba A15-S129 came with one 256 mb memory stick, with an open slot - making it easy to increase the memory without having to discard one of two 128 mb memory sticks (normally provided by other manufacturers) when upgrading.", "overall": 4.0, "label": "useful", "summary": "Value for the Price", "prior": "", "unixReviewTime": 1069718400, "unique": "1069718400ATG9MKT1LGGOF", "reviewTime": "11 25, 2003"}
