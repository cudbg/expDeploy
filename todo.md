Hamed
✔ Model experiments and create relationships between them
✔ Switch CharField to TextField, change {} to null
-Integrate with MTurk
psiTurk

Hamed:
✔ API to load data from completed tasks
✔ Resume feature / persistent tasks for each worker
✔ Task done --> Saved --> New Task Loaded 
✔ Look at MTURK API for WorkerID/How it sends 
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSMechTurk/latest/AWSMturkAPI/ApiReference_GetAssignmentOperation.html
✔ Async.js (good, but looks like overkill for what we are doing)

James:
