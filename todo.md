Hamed:
-API to load data from completed tasks
-Resume feature / persistent tasks for each worker
✔ Task done --> Saved --> New Task Loaded 
✔ Look at MTURK API for WorkerID/How it sends 
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSMechTurk/latest/AWSMturkAPI/ApiReference_GetAssignmentOperation.html
✔ Async.js (good, but looks like overkill for what we are doing)

James:
Usability 
-current user tagged at top of page
-Link to experiments on user profile page
-Delete experiment option on user profile page
-See results of experiments
-change experiment upload form to not need user field
-make possible that experiment names have space in them
-Many to one model for experiment
-restrict access to user if not logged in
-make it all pretty
-drag files onto webpage for upload
-hook up to MTurk

-Extendable template so researcher does not see autoescape tags
