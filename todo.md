Hamed:
-API to load data from completed tasks
-Resume feature / persistent tasks for each worker
✔ Task done --> Saved --> New Task Loaded 
✔ Look at MTURK API for WorkerID/How it sends 
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSMechTurk/latest/AWSMturkAPI/ApiReference_GetAssignmentOperation.html
✔ Async.js (good, but looks like overkill for what we are doing)

James:
Usability 
-See list of experiments
-See list of files for each experiment
-See results

-Add User accounts, restrict to users with .edu
