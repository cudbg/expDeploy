Hamed: Some comments

`index.html` contains the main page.

* there are script tags in `<head>` that I kept to debug locally.  
* I also commented out the `<script>` tage at the end of the file that does the serverside js loading. There could be a better way to handle this.

`util.js` contains the utility code for rendering things

`experiment1.js` contains the `setupExperiment.js` code

* I left comments `// wu: XXX` for you.  Some are suggestions, others are questions
* the bottom of the file is a simple test case to shown a task.  That works.

`params.js` contains the parameters.  Some of the parameters are javascript functions!  How should we deal with that?  You can punt and force me to give each function a name and manage it myself in the experiment code.
